# Cyclistic Bikeshare-Membership-Classification-analysis

In 2016, Cyclistic successfully launched a bike-sharing service in Chicago, boasting a fleet of over 5,800 bikes. In order to accommodate a diverse range of riders, Cyclistic offers three distinct pricing plans: the Single-Ride Pass, the Full-Day Pass, and the Annual Membership. These options cater to two primary types of riders: the casual riders, who typically prefer the single-ride or full-day passes, and the members, who opt for the convenience of an annual membership.

The primary objective of the Director of Marketing is to encourage casual riders to make the transition into becoming annual members. In pursuit of this goal, a comprehensive report has been generated to gain insights into the riding patterns and behaviors of Cyclistic customers. As a member of the data analytics team, my responsibility is to analyze and discern the differences in how casual riders and annual members utilize the Cyclistic service.

**Goal of the project:** 
build Machine Learning models to classify whether bike share users will purchase mambership options oe not, using 5 different ML models & advanced feature engineering techniques with Python ScikitLearn.
